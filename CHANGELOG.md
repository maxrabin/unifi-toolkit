# Changelog

All notable changes to UI Toolkit will be documented in this file.

## [1.8.6] - 2026-02-02

### Threat Watch v0.4.0

#### Fixed
- **Network 10.x support** - Fixed Threat Watch not displaying any IPS events on UniFi Network 10.x. Ubiquiti moved IPS events from the legacy `stat/ips/event` endpoint to a new v2 `traffic-flows` API. Threat Watch now tries the v2 API first and falls back to legacy for older firmware. (#10)

#### Improved
- **Debug endpoint** - The `/threats/api/events/debug/test-fetch` endpoint now tests both APIs and reports which one is working, making it easier to diagnose issues.

## [1.8.5] - 2025-01-12

### Wi-Fi Stalker v0.11.4

#### Fixed
- **Device status notifications** - Fixed a bug where connection/disconnection toast notifications were not triggering because the status comparison happened after the device data was already updated.
- **Byte formatting edge case** - Fixed dead code where the `bytes === 0` check was unreachable because it was placed after a falsy check that already caught zero values.

#### Improved
- **Code cleanup** - Removed unused imports, simplified display name logic, consolidated repetitive code into loops, and modernized string concatenation to template literals.

---

## [1.8.4] - 2025-01-11

### Wi-Fi Stalker v0.11.3

#### Improved
- **Faster device details modal** - Modal now opens instantly with cached data while live UniFi data loads in the background. Previously, clicking a device would wait for the API call to complete before showing the modal.

---

## [1.8.3] - 2025-01-10

### Wi-Fi Stalker v0.11.2

#### Improved
- **Condensed Presence Pattern heat map** - Reduced heat map from 24 rows to 12 by aggregating data into 2-hour blocks. Cells are now shorter rectangles instead of squares, allowing the entire heat map to fit within the modal without scrolling.

---

## [1.8.2] - 2025-01-10

### Wi-Fi Stalker v0.11.1

#### Fixed
- **Presence Pattern days calculation** - Fixed incorrect "days of data" display in Presence Pattern analytics. Previously showed "1 day(s)" even after 10+ days of tracking because it was incorrectly calculating from sample counts instead of the device's actual tracking start date.

---
